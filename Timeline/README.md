## How to Use This Directory

### Main Timeline Document
The primary document in this directory is `Chronological_Events.md`, which provides a sequential listing of all relevant events in Tia's case. This document should be regularly updated as new incidents occur or as more information about past events becomes available.

### When to Update the Timeline
The timeline should be updated:
- Whenever a new incident occurs
- When new information about a previous incident is discovered
- After significant communications with facility staff
- When formal actions (complaints, legal consultations, etc.) are taken
- When there are changes to Tia's status or treatment

### Information to Include

1. **Date and Time**: Be as precise as possible
2. **Brief Description**: Concise summary of what occurred
3. **Cross-Reference**: Link to detailed documentation in other directories
4. **Key People**: Names of individuals involved
5. **Significance**: Note if the event represents a pattern or escalation

### Organization
Events in the timeline should be:
- Listed in strict chronological order
- Grouped by date
- Formatted consistently
- Tagged by type (incident, communication, action, etc.)
