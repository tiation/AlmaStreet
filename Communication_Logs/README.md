# Communication Logs

## Purpose
This directory contains detailed records of all significant communications between Tia and facility staff. These logs provide documentation of verbal exchanges, instructions, contradictions, and other interactions that may be relevant to understanding and addressing potential rights violations.

## How to Use This Directory

### When to Create a Communication Log
Create a new communication log entry whenever:
- Tia has a significant interaction with facility staff
- Information is provided or requested by staff
- Contradictory information is given by different staff members
- Staff makes statements about Tia's rights or privileges
- Staff makes threats or promises regarding Tia's care or status
- Requests are made by Tia and responses are given

### Naming Convention
Name each communication log file using the following format:
```
YYYY-MM-DD_HHmm_Brief_Description.md
```
Example: `2025-05-26_1100_Gym_Access_Discussion.md`

### Required Information
Each communication log should include:
1. **Date and Time**: When the communication occurred
2. **Location**: Where the interaction took place
3. **Participants**: All individuals present during the communication
4. **Initiator**: Who started the conversation
5. **Content**: What was discussed, with verbatim quotes when possible
6. **Outcome**: Any decisions, agreements, or actions resulting from the communication
7. **Impact**: How this communication affected Tia

### Using the Template
A template file named `Communication_Log_Template.md` is provided in this directory. Copy this template for each new communication log entry.

## Log Organization
Maintain the communication logs in chronological order to facilitate reference and pattern identification. Consider categorizing logs by:
- Staff member involved
- Topic of discussion
- Nature of interaction (request, information, contradiction, etc.)

## Integrating with Other Documentation
Communications often relate to specific incidents or lead to formal actions. When creating communication logs:
1. Cross-reference related incident reports
2. Update the main timeline with significant communications
3. Note if the communication relates to a meeting request
4. Document any references to laws or policies

## Important Reminders
- Record communications as soon as possible after they occur
- Be as objective and detailed as possible
- Distinguish between direct quotes and paraphrased content
- Note the tone, demeanor, and non-verbal aspects of the communication
- Include contextual information that may be relevant
- Maintain confidentiality of the logs
- Remember that these logs may be used in legal proceedings

## Communication Patterns to Monitor
Pay special attention to patterns in communications, such as:
- Contradictory information from different staff members
- Inconsistent application of rules or policies
- Dismissive or disrespectful language
- Threats or intimidation
- Gaslighting or denial of previous statements
- Refusal to provide information in writing
