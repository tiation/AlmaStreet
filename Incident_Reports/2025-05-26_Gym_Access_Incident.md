## Incident Description

### Sequence of Events
1. At approximately 11:00 AM, Nurse Maddy informed Tia that she was not allowed to go to the gym.
2. Tia responded that she had been to the gym the previous day.
3. Nurse Maddy contradicted this statement, saying "No you didn't."
4. Tia clarified her statement, saying "Fine, on Friday or whatever. I HAVE BEEN TO THE GYM."
5. Tia was again told she was not allowed to go to the gym.
6. Tia then knocked on a doctor's door, entered, and stated "I am allowed to go to the gym. It is healthy."
7. Approximately 10 minutes later, a different nurse approached Tia and said "What are you talking about? You're allowed to go to the gym."

### Additional Context
- This incident appears to involve contradictory information being provided to Tia about her gym privileges.
- The contradictory information from different staff members could potentially constitute gaslighting behavior.
- Tia has also been accused of recording conversations with staff members or having someone on speakerphone during interactions with nursing staff.
- Tia requested a meeting with doctors with a support person present three times on May 27, 2025, but these requests were denied.
- Staff has indicated that if Tia records interactions with doctors or is on a call during these interactions, she would be placed under the Mental Health Act (currently she is a voluntary patient) and her electronic devices would be confiscated.

## Patient Rights Concerns
1. **Right to accurate information**: Tia received contradictory information about her privileges.
2. **Right to support**: Requests for a support person during meetings have been denied.
3. **Right to privacy**: Accusations regarding recording without clear evidence.
4. **Intimidation**: Threats of involuntary commitment and confiscation of property.

## Next Steps
1. Request written clarification of Tia's rights and privileges, including gym access.
2. Document all future contradictory information provided by staff.
3. Research applicable sections of the Mental Health Act regarding:
   - Rights to support persons
   - Conditions for involuntary commitment
   - Recording policies
   - Property rights of patients
4. Request a formal meeting with facility administration to address these concerns.
